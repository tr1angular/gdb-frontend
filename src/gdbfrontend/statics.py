"""
GDB-Frontend GUI modes.

GDB-Frontend can run different GUI modes:
WEB      : Accessible via http://host:port/ and layout does not contain GDB terminal.
WEB_TMUX : Same as WEB but layout contains GDB terminal on bottom.
GUI      : It means layout is being opened from native GUI.
           Also in this mode, layout contains GDB terminal at bottom as natively.
